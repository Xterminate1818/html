    <h2 class="distinct"> Motivation </h2>
    HTML is a powerful tool for creating static web pages, but 
    is not easily modular or scalable. Front end frameworks like
    React provide reusable components. I want to use components
    without the overhead of a front-end framework. I want the final
    output to be statically generated rather than generated on the fly
    by the server or the client, minified and with inlined CSS and 
    JavaScript.
    <h2 class="distinct"> Approach </h2>
    After looking at some of the HTML parsing libraries, I was 
    unsatisfied with the approaches most developers took. The DOM
    is represented as a tree structure, where each node keeps a 
    pointer to its children.
<@code lang="rust">
// From the html_parser crate
pub enum Node {
    Text(String),
    Element(Element),
    Comment(String),
}

pub struct Element {
    pub name: String,
    pub attributes: HashMap<String, Option<String>>,
    pub children: Vec<Node>,
    // other fields omitted
}
</@code>
  This is bad for cache locality and effectively forces the use
  of recursion in order to traverse the DOM. Recursion is undesirable
  for performance and robustness reasons. My approach is to create a
  flat array of elements.
<@code lang="rust">
// My implementation (fields omitted)
pub enum HtmlElement {
  DocType,
  Comment(/* */),
  OpenTag { /* */ },
  CloseTag { /* */ },
  Text( /* */ ),
  Script { /* */ },
  Style { /* */ },
  Directive { /* */ },
}
</@code>
  This approach lends itself to linear iterative algorithms. An 
  element's children can be represented as a slice of the DOM array, 
  from the opening tag to its close tag.
  <h2 class="distinct"> Templates </h2> 
  I define a "template" as a user defined element which expands into
  a larger piece of HTML. Templates can pass on children and attributes
  to the final output. Some special templates can perform other functions,
  like inlining a CSS file or syntax highlighting a code block.
<@code lang="html">
<!-- Here is an example of a template definition -->
<Echo> 
  <!-- 
    This means to inherit the 'class' attribute from the invocation
  -->
  <h1 class=@class> 
    <!-- 
      This means place the children of the invocation here
    -->
    <@children/>
  </h1>
  <h2> 
  <!-- This means to inherit the 'href' attribute from the invocation -->
    <a href="@href"> 
      <!-- Children can be duplicated any number of times -->
      <@children/> 
    </a> 
  </h2>
  <!-- 
    Attributes can also be duplciated, and boolean attributes
    work exactly as expected 
  -->
  <h3 class=@class hidden=@hidden>  
    <@children/> 
  </h3>
</Echo>
<!-- End of template definition -->
</@code>
  </div>
